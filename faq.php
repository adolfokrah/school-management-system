                        <ol class="breadcrumb"><h3><strong>1. HOW DOES YOUR SYSTEM WORK?</strong> </h3></ol>
<p>After you register, we provide free training section at your school or you can also call our Support Team to walk you through the usage via phone. You can as well read more from our "ABOUT" page. We are working on a video tutorial to explain how all the features work.</p>

                        <ol class="breadcrumb"><h3><strong>2. HOW CAN I REGISTER AND USE THE SOFTWARE?</strong></h3></ol>
<p>Our online software is designed to allow for the easy management of every school. To have access to the software, you must first register by purchasing a voucher from us at 100 cedis. You then visit our website and click on "<a href="register.php">JOIN US</a>" then. Follow the steps provided to register and input the code at the final registration stage to register.</p>
                        
                        <ol class="breadcrumb"><h3><strong>3. CAN I REGISTER ONLINE WITHOUT VISITING YOUR OFFICE?</strong></h3></ol>
<p>Yes you can. You can buy our voucher through mobile money and send us the invoice provide during the registration then we provide you<br/>

                        <ol class="breadcrumb"><h3><strong>4. CAN I HAVE MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT?</strong></h3></ol>
<p>Our system is designed to allow for registration for one account per each school. However, if you want to manage more than one school, we advice you register and pay for each school separately.</p>
                        
                        <ol class="breadcrumb"><h3><strong>5. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO USE THE SOFTWARE?</strong></h3></ol>
<p>The cost of using this wonderful software/tool cannot be compared to its benefits. We understand the financial strength of most schools especially in Africa, therefore we reduce the cost to meet every schools budget. Currently we allow every school the opportunity to use the software at a cost of 100 cedis per each academic term. This is subject to change as the features and the  economic situation changes.</p>
                        
                        <ol class="breadcrumb"><h3><strong>6. HOW SECURED IS IT?</strong></h3></ol>
<p>After you register, you have control over the entire software and all its features without fear of losing or experiencing any hacker threat on your school's data.
Our team of Professional Developers integrated high security practices into the software's development lifecycle and has also verified the inbuilt server side security before they deployed to help mitigate risk from internal and external sources.
We also included Access Control measures which allow users to deciding who needs what access to which data and to which features and how these rules will be enforced.
</p>
